# DISCORD-BOT-ALFRED
~ An experimental and work-in-progress Discord bot ~ <br>
Alfred is very much like from Batman. He welcomes the incoming users with a meaningful message. <br>
This is my first time coding a discord bot and first time creating my personal github project.

## Current features:
#### Chat
* Sends a welcome message or farewell message whenever a user joins or leaves the server.
* Cleans the chat and preserved pinned messages.
#### Fun
* Plays rocks, papers and scissors.
* Do a coin flip.
* Generate a random number between given range.
* Answer in 8ball toy like fashion. (random answers without taking the questions)
## Planned features:
* Alfred shows all the list of commands that he can do if user asks.
* User can input a name of the city and Alfred will fetch weather details of the city from an weather api.
* User can quick search for top-rated restaurants with the specified cuisine and location.
